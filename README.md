# Twitter sentiment analysis project 

### Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a Logistic Regression model that can classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project includes a training and validation dataset, word clouds for visualization, and a confusion matrix for model evaluation.

#### Background
Sentiment analysis is a vital application of NLP, providing insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and brand perception. This project specifically targets Twitter data, aiming to understand the sentiment behind tweets.

#### Features
The project includes:
* Training and Validation Datasets: Labeled datasets for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
* Word Clouds: Visual representations of the most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.
*Logistic Regression Model: Trained using Bag of Words (BoW) representation and considering stopwords for better sentiment classification. and also trained without stopwords and BOW model.
* Confusion Matrix: Used to evaluate the performance of the model.

#### Predictions
> Once trained, the model can predict the sentiment of new text inputs.
